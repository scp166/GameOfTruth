# Inheritance

- In the Era7 metaverse, when a new generation of cards are synthesized, each gene has the opportunity to be transmitted and continued. The new Era7card inherits a certain percentage of attributes from several cards of the previous generation, as well as a certain percentage of genetic mutations. 

- For example, the attack power, defense power, HP of battle cards and the special effects of different biological cards. 

- The quality (common, rare, epic or legend) of the Battle Card summoned by the master card and the inheritance master card will also have random differences in each attribute.
