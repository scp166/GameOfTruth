- In the dimensional spacetime, the Titan God created the Titan realm in the dark void. The Titan realm is composed of five different planes (God and demon world, phantom world, magic world and Locke world) centered on the Kevlar world. The Titan God created different races and creatures in different worlds. In order to prevent the erosion and degeneration of forces from the dark void, after creating the Titan world, the Titan God turned his last trace of divine power into a star jewel and placed it in the center of the Titan realm-the wisdom island of Kevlar world. The Star Jewel forms a huge energy barrier to protect the Titan realm.

- There is a race living on the island of Wisdom Skago. The divine sense of the Titan's divine power gives this race the responsibility of guarding the jewels of the star world. They have the ability to communicate with the gods in nature, and the ability to produce wings to fly. As the sun and moon change and time goes by, the races in each world have their own different beliefs and forms. They have experienced war and peace, and they have established different countries and ethnic groups. However, the skago people of wisdom island have been passing on from generation to generation for tens of thousands of years. They work at sunrise and rest at sunset. There is no war and no business. They are isolated from the world. When the Star Jewel became a legend, and people had forgotten the ancient mission, a mysterious force came quietly.

- On this day, the sun on the wisdom island has just set. After the coronation of the new king, you sit alone in the hall. The words of coronation read by the patriarch still reverberate in your ears. When you are immersed in joy and excitement, there is a noise outside the hall. Walking out of the hall, you see that the whole wisdom island is shrouded by a dark force, and then a powerful magic dragon army appears, hovering over the wisdom island. The flames from the magic dragon pour down like a torrential rain and hit the houses and streets. Pedestrians began to run in panic and screamed. In an instant, the whole wisdom island turned into a sea of fire. There was no sign of all this.

- Angrily, you ran to the sea of fire with your sword. You wanted to find the clan leader to save people. At this time, a huge magic dragon stood in front of you. You raised your sword and angrily stabbed the magic dragon to start a fight with the magic dragon, but the ability you learned in your life was not as good as the fire that the dragon spit... The flames drowned you and you lost consciousness, In the coma, you seem to hear the voice of the patriarch: â€œEven if you sacrifice the lives of the whole family, let your highness live!" when you wake up, you are in another city, and the key is in your hand. "It's the patriarch..." the patriarch gave you the key to the magic tower. You finally understand that the legend is true. Darkness is coming.
