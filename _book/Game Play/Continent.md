# Continent

- In Era7 metaverse, there are a large number of lands for players to build and operate their own homes in future. Players can use various resources and processing materials found in the game to upgrade their own lands. In addition, the owner of land can find his own mark on the world map. Using the Era7cards in his home to explore the world map can obtain Era tokens. When the enemy wins the battle, he can also obtain Era tokens. Players also have a certain probability of obtaining Era tokens through land. 

- This is also the best form of Era7 combined with metaverse concept. Players have land development rights, and land owners will receive abundant resources and subsidies.This will be the work and direction that the project party will focus on in the future.
