</li>
<li><p>DeFi: First burst in July 2020, peak in March 2021, accepted by traditional technology and finance.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>GameFi: The first burst will come in July 2021, and the boom is just around the corner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The global game market continues to expand, and the industry is in a good situation. According to the statistics of newzoo, the scale of the global game market has increased from US $70.6 billion in 2012 to US $177.8 billion in 2020, with a CAGR of 12.2%, and is expected to exceed US $200 billion in 2023. The proportion of mobile games has risen from 12% in 2012 to 49% in 2020 and is expected to reach 52% in 2021. The global game market will continue to grow. The overall development trend of the industry is good and the space is vast.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In 2020, $72 million was invested in blockchain games, and as of July 30, 2021, more than $1 billion has been invested.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Metaverse is a virtual world built on the blockchain. The decentralized platform allows users to enjoy ownership and autonomy. The immersive experience brings the virtual closer to reality. Users can shuttle freely between the physical world and the digital world anytime, anywhere, and complete most of the behaviors in real life in the metaverse composed of virtual space-time nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Metaverse is the development vision of the Internet and has become a reasonable direction for the development and exploration of the game industry with the longterm development of digital infrastructure, terminal equipment, game content and virtual currency technology. Metaverse is expected to bring more entertainment, social mode, work collaboration and the ability to regain personal value to human society. Blockchain game is the best way to present Metaverse and will continue to make social breakthroughs and evolutions in concepts such as open world, UGC and virtual currency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From basic ecology to application scenarios, metaverse and gamefi launched an allround war, just like the &quot;Cambrian explosion&quot;, which gave birth to a variety of applications. From the current industry point of view, It is not only encryption art, but the rapid development of NFT has also set off a game craze. Different from blockchain games a few years ago, the diversity of gameplay and the innovation of game mechanism provide more possibilities and explosive power for the game field. Models such as P2E (pay to earn) and NFT have accelerated the popularity of metaverse and gamefi concepts, and have also broken the barriers of previous blockchain projects.</p>
