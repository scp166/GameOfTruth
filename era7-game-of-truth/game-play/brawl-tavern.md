# Brawl Tavern

## Brawl Tavern is a PvP mode that allows you to customize the battle room.

You can unlock it when you reach Lv. 6 in Quick Match. You can either create your own room or join a room created by another player, having a 1v1 battle. The winner gets double the Bet Amount, calculated by deducting a 5% of Battle Tax, while the Loser loses their Bet amount. Meanwhile, Lucky Bonus and Lucky Jackpot are generated randomly and waiting for you.
