# Summoning

* A player may use their Summoning Skills to randomly obtain new combat cards through the master card.&#x20;
* The master card needs to be purchased or traded by the player through the Era token.After obtaining the master card, the player can unseal and obtain the battle cards. The battle card can either be used for battle or can be traded. Moreover, the master card needs to consume Era token and GOT as fuel for breeding new battle cards. GOT is attained by participating in various game activities.

* The quality of the summoned Battle Card will correspond to the quality of the master card (which can be common, rare, epic or legendary class). The master card cannot fight, but is very precious, nevertheless.
