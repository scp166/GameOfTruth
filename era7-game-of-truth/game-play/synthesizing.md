# Synthesizing

* Battle cards enable players to play games. Players need to have acquired at least 30 battle cards before they can start fighting. Battle Cards also have corresponding qualities (common, rare, epic and legendary). Two battle cards with the same quality and the same name can combine to create a stronger GOT synthesis attribute.
* The synthesized Battle Card will randomly obtain higher attack power, defence and/or other values.
* Players using the synthesizing function tend to be stronger players overall. Synthetic high-level cards can be traded at a high price in the NFT market.
