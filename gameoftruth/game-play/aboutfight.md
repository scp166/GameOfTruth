# AboutFight

## Fighting

* The era7 game is played on the battlefield with 9 \* 9 squares on both sides of the player, which means that both sides will randomly draw hand cards from the built 30 card library, and then drag the battle card to play the game. Battle cards will attack and defend in each round, and some battle cards with characteristic effects will produce corresponding effects in each round. The battlefield is divided into three fronts. If there are no cards on the opponent's front, attribute damage will be caused to the cards on the player's corresponding front. When the opponent's HP drops to 0, it is a victory; Conversely, if your HP drops to 0, it is a failure.
* The core essentials of combat are: to establish battlefield advantages and powerful card groups, and to play games with opponents through careful consideration.
