# Inheritance

* In the Era7 metaverse, when a new generation of cards is synthesized, each genus has the opportunity to pass traits on. The new Era7 card inherits a certain percentage of attributes from several cards of the previous generation, as well as a certain percentage of genetic mutations.&#x20;
* For example, the attack power, defence power, battle card HP and the special effects of different biological cards may be passed on.
* The quality of the Battle Card (common, rare, epic or legendary) summoned by the master card and the inheritance master card will also have random attribute differences.
